# SwaggerHub API specs sync

24i API's from [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/24i-API) are synced to this repository. This enables an edit history as well as a backup for all our API specs. See https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/integrations/github-sync

The Integration plugin syncs the different versions of the different APIs to branches based on the master branch and named like so: `swaggerhub-{API name}-{version name}`
